## Idea

Developing a decentralized crowdsourcing platform to facilitate submitting and solving HITs (Human Inteligence Tasks).

## Motivation

AI and Blockchain seem to be the buzzwords of today. Even though we've seen lots of progress being made in the artificial intelligence world such as personal assistants and [board games](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24270), there are still way more things humans perform much better than there are problems being solved better by AIs than humans.
Some of these problems might not be suited for AI but probably most of these problems lack huge, flawelessly labeled data sets to train on. While big corporations such as Google are able to exploit their monopolies to create such datasets [without even having to pay the workers](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/), it gradually gets more difficult and expensive the less power one holds.
What if we could develop a decentralized crowdsourcing platform to form a community around solving HITs? What if the members of this community could be incentivised to submit their best work by receiving tokenized reward? A lot of joy could be attained by understanding and applying the yet very new field of cryptoeconomics and we could potentially set the founding stone for something which could eventually transform into a labour market without the need of any middle man, both enabling small businesses and less skilled workers to create value in the world of today.
Very recent research into [Token Curated Registries](https://medium.com/@ilovebagels/token-curated-registries-1-0-61a232f8dac7) and
[Curated Governance with Stake Machines](https://medium.com/@DimitriDeJonghe/curated-governance-with-stake-machines-8ae290a709b4) but also the very sarcastic [$TEAK Network](https://steak.network/assets/steak-network_whitepaper.pdf) and the research its based upon such as [Validation Games](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~teutsch/papers/truebit.pdf) and [PLCR Voting](https://blog.colony.io/towards-better-ethereum-voting-protocols-7e54cb5a0119) should provide enough groundwork to use to develop such a platform.
